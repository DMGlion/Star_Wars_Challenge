     * As part of a code challenge I have used an API available here: https://swapi.co/ Â 
     * This app displays how many stops for resupply are required to cover a given distance,
     * The application is taking as input a distance in mega lights (MGLT) given by an user
     * The output is a collection of all the star ships and the total amount of stops required to make the distance between the planets.
     * Future application will be added soon.
